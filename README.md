- [multi-image-kontext-pro](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/multi-image-kontext-pro), [multi-image-kontext-max](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/multi-image-kontext-max)

## Development Steps

1. Complete necessary configuration and startup steps according to [Nexty Documentation](https://nexty.dev/docs). Since this is based on Nexty, all necessary steps to start Nexty are required for this project
2. Search globally for `Nexty AI Image` and `flux-kontext.nexty.dev` in Cursor or VSCode, change the brand name to your product name, check `config/site.ts`, and update your website information
3. Create product pricing in Stripe, then update your pricing cards in Dashboard/prices, **must change Stripe Price ID to your own**, then test the payment flow
4. Add new features:
  - Update your AI feature configuration `config/featureList.ts`
  - For new AI feature configurations, if parameters differ from existing features, check if the server-side logic in `app/api/ai/replicate/flux-kontent/submit/route.ts` is compatible (generally it is), this is a universal processing interface
  - Since Flux Kontext only supports English prompts, but we can't require users to input English only, this template provides prompt translation functionality, code in `app/api/ai/replicate/flux-kontent/submit/prompt-optimizer.ts`, this is also a universal processing method, you don't need to modify the code, just confirm if the prompt translation meets your requirements, then choose your preferred AI model and configure environment variables (`IMAGE_PROMPT_TRANSLATE_PROVIDER`, `IMAGE_PROMPT_TRANSLATE_MODEL` and the API_KEY for your chosen platform)
  - This project uses Replicate Webhook to implement the core workflow. You need to set the environment variable `REPLICATE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, which should be generated at [replicate](https://replicate.com/account/webhook)
  - Replicate Webhook requires a specific address. Since development and production environments have different server addresses, use the environment variable `REPLICATE_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` to configure the host. For local development, use the Forwarded Address exposed address (as shown in the image), and for production environment, use your production domain address.

  - Add a new file with the same name in each language folder under `i18n/messages`, then import the new file in `i18n/messages/request.ts`
  - In Cursor, select any feature module from `app/[locale]/(gen-image)`, select `config/featureList.ts`, select the newly created file in the `i18n/messages` language folder, and copy the AI model documentation links you want to use (e.g., [restore-image](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/restore-image), [restore-image-api](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/restore-image/api/api-reference)) to the Cursor dialog. Ask AI to develop a new page based on existing functionality, first complete the AI function area, and supplement the multilingual package to the json file.
  - Ask AI to design a page with the same structure based on existing feature modules and complete SEO content
5. Update website materials and meta information
   - Logo: [https://www.logo.surf/](https://www.logo.surf/), [https://ray.so/icon](https://ray.so/icon?q=), [https://icon.kitchen/](https://icon.kitchen/)
   - OG Image: [https://ogimage.click](https://ogimage.click)
   - Website meta information configuration: `lib/metadata.ts`, default is general configuration, supports displaying different meta information for different languages
