      {
        "question": "What kind of photos work best?",
        "answer": "Front-facing or 3/4 portraits with good lighting yield the most accurate figurine likeness. Avoid heavy filters or low resolution images."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change outfits or props?",
        "answer": "Yes. Use prompt keywords such as “cyberpunk armor” or “holding a neon katana” to instantly restyle the figurine."
