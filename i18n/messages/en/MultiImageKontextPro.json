    "title": "Common Questions About Nexty AI Image",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How is this different from using Photoshop or other photo editors?",
        "answer": "Traditional photo editors require you to manually mask, blend, and color-match images—skills that take years to master. Nexty AI Image's Flux kontext multi-image AI does all this technical work automatically. You just describe what you want, and our AI handles the complex parts like matching lighting and perspective."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of photo combinations work best with your AI?",
        "answer": "Our Flux kontext multi-image technology excels at everything from realistic combinations (like placing people in new locations) to creative mashups (like combining objects from different scenes). It works great for both practical business needs and artistic projects."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I get my results?",
        "answer": "Most combinations complete in 15-45 seconds. The AI needs time to analyze both images and figure out how they should naturally work together, but it's still much faster than manual editing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file types can I upload?",
        "answer": "We support PNG, JPG, and WEBP files. Your final image can be downloaded in either PNG or JPG format, whichever works better for your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to create combinations?",
        "answer": "Each combination costs 10 credits. New users get 30 free credits to try the service—that's 3 full combinations to see if Nexty AI Image works for your needs before spending anything."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the results for business or commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You own the rights to images you create with Nexty AI Image. Just make sure your original input images don't violate anyone else's copyrights, since you're responsible for what you upload."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I write good prompts for better results?",
        "answer": "Be specific about what you want: describe which elements should combine, how they should relate to each other, and the overall mood you're after. For example: 'Place the woman from image 1 in the mountain scene from image 2, with warm evening lighting.'"
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I don't like how my combination turned out?",
        "answer": "You can always try again with a different description or slightly different images. Our AI learns from more detailed prompts, so being more specific about lighting, positioning, or style usually improves results. Each attempt uses credits, but you can keep refining your approach."
